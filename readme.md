## Overview

The Rational Musician Trainer is a project to supply a certain necessity for professional and amateur musicians in their musical training. Even before the tones and organised musical sounds are performed or simply played, to have some basic patterns of musical theory embeded in the memory and mind possibilitates a bigger freedom and comprehention to the musician in his or hers subsequently musical process as the material they will work with, musical pieces, gets each time more complex.

Just like any other language where one should be able to memorise and master patterns of conjugation, syntatic structures and some times declinations in order to comunicate, express and concatenate ideas in their clearest form, musicians should ideally in the same way possess a variety of musical patterns like scales, modes and intervals always in the back of their minds to be able to speak, understand and write the language of music.

The aim of The Rational Musician Trainer is to work some of these patterns and provide in this way the professional or amateur musician this solid and automatized patterns providing more freedom in their musical processes: be it playing, composing, listening.

## UX

### User stories
## First-Time Visitor Goals

* to be able to track my progress in every module played.
* to not be distracted by any other unnecessary stimuli that not the exercice being practiced.
* be able to use the app on my mobile device.
* to be able to train my focus during the exercices.


## Returning Visitor Goals
#### As a return/ frequent visitor I want :
* to maintain the progress of the contents practiced in the app.
* to keep track of my progress in every module and difficulty in the app.
* to keep trainnig my focus with the increasing difficulties on every module.

### Structure
The application consists of four pages:
* index Page: Where the user have access to the four modules to be worked and the three levels of difficulty.
* Quiz Page: Where the actual quiz will take place with a metronome sound marking the time the user has to answer all the questions.
* Congrats page: Where the visitor will receave some feedback and the score last achieved. 
* MyStats page: Where the visitor will be able to track his/her progress in every module and difficulty through a table. The best score in every module and difficulty is display in the same.

### Design

The Website was designed to have a minimalistic and simple layout to avoid major distractions and focus in the aquirement of the musical patterns and structures intended.

#### Colour Scheme

The white colour is associated with knowledge and learning in the Tibetan tradition and is the basic colour for the Website for the same reason. The #252525 colour was used for the fonts over the white and brighter backgrounds to keep the text always easy to read, but not overtly black and fitting to the pastel tones of the Website.

White is the main colour of the palette being with a slightly gray black for the text and the blue of the logo, buttons and icons to give a sense of variaty, though stability.

The second palette displays the colours used in smaller details. Namely the hover effect of the buttons in the whole application, the vidian green used in the quiz pages for the correctly answered questions and the persian red for wrong ones.

### Typography
The Roboto font family was here applied to give the website a modern, succinct, direct apperence.
 
### Imagery
The logo was built using photoshop and the font awesome website.

The blue four lines eludes the patterns of knowledge that once learned and automatized shine bright and highlights naturally to serve as a great reference in the learning process.

## Visual Effects   

### Index Page

#### Radio Buttons

The Buttons in the index Page were created using the radio buttons function from the HTML language. The checked function native to the radio buttons in a form would enable just the right effect for the buttons that will be chosen or to give this "checked by default" effect. 

### Span

The span were used to create this border around the instructions in the middle of the index page. The idea was to make even more obvious to the user that he/she should click both categories (Module and Difficulty) before proceding to the Quiz page. The border emulates the form of the buttons.

### Hover

All buttons in the page use the hover effect in a different tone to make a clear distinction between the clicked and hovered ones.
